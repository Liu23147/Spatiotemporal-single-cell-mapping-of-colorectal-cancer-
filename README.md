Tumor microenvironment is critical to the progression of colorectal cancer. Although tumor-adjacent normal tissue (ANT) is frequently used as a control in colorectal cancer  studies due to its histologically benign appearance, emerging evidence suggests that ANT may undergo tumor-induced molecular reprograming. However, the composition and distribution of immune cells within ANT and its functional interplay with malignant lesions remain poorly characterized. Here, we integrate single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data from approximately 300 human colorectal samples to comprehensively map the transcriptional landscape of normal, ANT and tumor tissues. Our analysis reveals that several immune cell subpopulations in ANT more closely resemble those found in tumors. We identify two unique myeloid-derived immunosuppressive cell subpopulations shared between ANT and tumor tissues, namely GPR34-positive macrophages, which autocrinely secrete LysoPS, and monocytes, which are involved in the T cell ANXA1–FPR axis. Furthermore, we uncover a tumor-specific plasma cell-derived IgG–FCGR3B axis that promotes neutrophil recruitment and maturation to facilitate immune escape. Our findings challenge the conventional use of ANT as a benign control, re-define the spatial boundaries of tumor influence and provide critical insights into immune dysfunction in colorectal cancer.
